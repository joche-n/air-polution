​Predicting urban air pollution using satellite data is a complex task that requires careful planning and the application of appropriate statistical methods. Below is a suggested workflow and recommended methodologies to guide your group project:​

1. Project Workflow
a. Data Acquisition and Understanding

Collect Data: Obtain satellite observations from the Sentinel-5P satellite, which tracks various atmospheric pollutants, and gather relevant weather data.​

Explore Data: Conduct an initial analysis to understand data structures, identify missing values, and assess the distribution of pollutants across different regions.​

b. Data Preprocessing

Handle Missing Data: Implement strategies such as interpolation or imputation to address gaps in the dataset.​

Feature Engineering: Create new features that may enhance predictive performance, such as combining related variables or calculating pollutant concentration trends.​

Normalization: Standardize data to ensure consistency, especially when combining datasets from different sources.​

c. Model Selection and Training

Choose Models: Select appropriate statistical and machine learning models based on data characteristics and project goals.​

Train Models: Divide the data into training and validation sets to build and fine-tune the models.​

d. Model Evaluation

Assess Performance: Use metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared to evaluate model accuracy.​

Cross-Validation: Apply techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and generalizability.​

e. Deployment and Monitoring

Implement Model: Deploy the trained model to predict air pollution levels in various cities.​

Monitor Performance: Continuously evaluate the model's predictions against real-world data and update as necessary to maintain accuracy.​

2. Recommended Statistical Methods
a. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

Application: Models the relationship between pollutant concentrations and multiple independent variables such as meteorological factors.​

Consideration: Effective for understanding linear relationships but may not capture complex, non-linear interactions.​

b. Land Use Regression (LUR)

Application: Combines geographic and environmental data to predict spatial variations in air pollution.​

Consideration: Useful for high-resolution spatial analysis but requires detailed land-use data.​

c. Universal Kriging (UK)

Application: A geostatistical method that interpolates spatial data, accounting for both trend and spatial autocorrelation.​

Consideration: Assumes stationarity and may be computationally intensive for large datasets.​

d. Machine Learning Approaches

Random Forest (RF): An ensemble method that can model complex, non-linear relationships and handle interactions between variables.​

Support Vector Regression (SVR): Effective for capturing non-linear patterns, especially in high-dimensional spaces.​

Neural Networks (NN): Capable of modeling intricate patterns but require substantial data and computational resources.​
